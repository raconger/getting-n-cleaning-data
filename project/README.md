# Project details

## file logistics
Download and unzip the folder within the home directory to get this to run. All file references in **run_analysis.R** are made with the preamble *"./UCI HAR Dataset/*

## libraries needed
Within R, I used the following libraries:
- Hmisc
- reshape2

## HowTo

Once you have the libraries extracted as they are above (or if you fork this repo), source **run_analysis.R**. It will print the final table and write it to a text file named **output.txt**.
